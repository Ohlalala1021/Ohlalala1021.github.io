Guess what we’ve had? There are fried chicken burgers and fried French fries, we even had spaghetti! I pretended to be a great chef, and put the French fries into the burger, when I was about to have a bite, I suddenly thought about my mother, whom I inherited her wisdom from, so I decided to pack up this enormous burger and take it home to her to enjoy. This Friday afternoon after I’ve finished my homework, I went to Alan’s house for a sleepover, on the way to his house, we’ve played a game called “sheep as a sheep”, the rule is that you need to make three same objects together and they will disappear, and you need to make all the objects disappear to win. At the first stage of the game, it’s rather easy like what you do at the kindergarten, but second stage is getting extremely hard, like what you need to do at university. And we tried it for fifty minutes and couldn’t pass, I thought it was very hard. Today I will go football with Ruby, and I guess there would be something interesting happening, which i’m looking forward to. And also tomorrow I will go camping with Alan, mom said we will going to take some lovely fruits and snacks for picnic, I so much look forward to tomorrow too.",-1),h=[n,r];function d(l,c){return o(),a("div",null,h)}const m=t(i,[["render",d],["__file","English2.html.vue"]]);export{m as default};
