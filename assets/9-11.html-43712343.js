Unfortunately, we were about three weeks early and the chestnuts were not ready to pick, because there were still green and growing on the trees. Still we had a go, and picked some green ones, but Ruby’s grandpa said there were none can be eaten, what a pity! But we still had fun and agreed we are going to come back when the nuts are ready.</p><p>Secondly, I went to Anji for a discovery tour for finding fossils. And I found many fossils of BiShi, they had very clear images of when there were alive. And i also discovered a precious fossil of an ancient sponge, it’s very old because it’s from Precambrian which is about 570 million years ago, I think I’ve spotted a big treasure which made my day.</p><p>Lastly, my mom took me to a concert tonight, which I think the music was beautiful, and the band was from the last concert we went to, and my mom thinks the piano girl is really pretty especially when she smiles.</p>',10),h=[l];function d(p,m){return t(),a("div",null,h)}const u=e(c,[["render",d],["__file","9-11.html.vue"]]);export{u as default};
