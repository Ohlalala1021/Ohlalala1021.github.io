<template><div><p>Sporty week</p>
<p>Sport is something you improve yourself with, you can have physical sports and brainy sports. Doing sports make you happy and sometimes you will have sense of achievement by doing sports well.</p>
<p>This week is full of sporting events, three sports events had happened, which are the Jumping Rope competition, the football match and the AMC test. Let me tell you one by one.</p>
<p>At the Jumping Rope competition, I performed well and counted myself had done 197 per minute, but the class 4 ** counted my numbers wrong only recorded 157 per minute, then I went to tell the teacher about the wrong records, and we recounted the numbers by watching the recordings. And discovered that my number was correct. I was satisfied by the results. I don’t mind the results because i know that I have done my best.</p>
<p>Then the football march, I have always been a good defender and gates keeper. But I have never been able to score a goal from this position before yesterday. At the beginning I made a big kick that made the ball fly all the way from our side to the opponent’s side, and scored! I was excited that I finally have scored but my teammates calmed me down, so I kept defending and performed well all through to the end.</p>
<p>Now the AMC which happened this Saturday. To be honest I was very nervous when I got the papers, my heart raced like a roller coaster. When I got over fifteen quiz, I finally came down, and I thought: oh. It’s not as difficult as I thought, I could get this! when I finally finished the test, I feel that my efforts was now wasted, and I was happy with myself and I think I will continue to do the practice every week to get more familiar with the quiz and i’m sure I will have a better score next year.</p>
<p>You see, sports are full of fun, and these activities gave me energy and fulfillment.</p>
